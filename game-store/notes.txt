 Responsive Styles
Chakra UI supports responsive styles out of the box.
 Instead of manually adding @media queries and adding nested styles
  throughout your code, Chakra UI allows you to provide object and array values to add mobile-first responsive styles.
  Remember, Chakra UI uses the min-width media query for responsive design. The breakpoints are: base = 0em, sm = 30em, md = 48em, lg = 62em, xl = 80em,, 2xl = 96em

Here's how to interpret this syntax fontSize={{ base: '24px', md: '40px', lg: '56px' }}:

24px: From 0em upwards
40px: From 48em upwards
56px: From 62em upwards
=> <Show above="lg">
          {" "}
          <GridItem area={"aside"} bg="pink">
            Aside
          </GridItem>
        </Show>
=> this will show the aside area when device widet is lg or above lg
